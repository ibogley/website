            The internet, paired with other complimentary digital tools available to us, provides an excellent opportunity to re-evaluate the way we make decisions and plan for a better future. My passion is to use data analysis for economic development, growth, and informed decision-making. I have relevant experience using both written, oral, and visual mediums for the communication of data-based insights.
