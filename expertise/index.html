          <h1>My Expertise</h1>
          <h2>Economic Development, International Economics, Macroeconomics, and Policy Analysis</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Economic Development</strong>: Two graduate level courses in economic development specifically, one graduate level urban and regional economies class, and one graduate level course in political economies. Outside of the classroom I worked with The International Development Group LLC, where I assisted with USAID and MCC contracts relating to projects in the Western Balkans (barriers to businesss according to the World Bank), Niger (Baseline data report on road usage patterns and demographics), and the Indo-Pacific region (organizing company files relating to regional subcontractors).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>International Economics</strong>: Three graduate level courses (Globalization, 2 terms of Economic Development) and one undergraduate level (International Finance)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Macroeconomics</strong>: Graduate course in macroeconomic theory covering stability analysis, comparative statics, and different macroeconomic models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Policy Analysis</strong>: One term of Graduate level policy analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Data analysis and Mathematics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Econometrics/Data analysis</strong>: Five quarters of Econometrics (Three in advanced, graduate level courses) throughout my undergraduate and graduate career. Other related courses include undergrauduate level courses in big data, forecasting, and business analytics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Machine Learning</strong>: One graduate level course (labeled EC 524: Econometrics) focused on machine learning through R. Used to predict NBA MVP candidates for each year since 1985.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Languages/Tools</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>R (Used in each of my econometrics courses and routinely for personal projects), Python (Used on personal projects)</li>
                <li>Excel (Used in my graduate level Natural Resource Economics course to model resource consumption paths, as well as in my work with The International Development Group to visualize road usage demographics and patterns)</li>
                <li>SQLite (Used in my undergraduate Business Analytics course)</li>
                <li>Google BigQuery, Apache Spark, Git, and Github (All four introduced to me through my undergraduate Big Data course, utilized with R)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mathematics</strong>: Statistics (Two terms, one introductory (B), one intermediate (A)), fundamental analysis (one term, A-), proofs (one term, A), and multivariable calculus (one term, B-).
