          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <h3>High School</h3>
          <p>
            I went to Crescent Valley High school in Corvallis, OR. While there, I enjoyed playing ultimate frisbee competitively.
          </p>
          <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
          <p>
            I began my career at my hometown university of Oregon State, before transferring to the University of Oregon during my freshman year. Soon after, I switched my major from math to economics, while taking two minors in business administration and mathematics.
          </p>
          <h3>Graduate</h3>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to take the one year accelerated Applied Master's program here at the University of Oregon. My studies focused on Data Science, Empirical Research, Public Policy, and International Trade. I will graduate in December of 2021.
          </p>
          <h3>Volunteer Work: A Family for Every Child</h3>
          <p>
            Starting in July of 2020, I volunteered with AFFEC, helping out with general office tasks. This included creating instructional guides, monitoring email marketing successes, and data entry.
          </p>
          <h3>Summer 2021: Intern at International Development Group LLC</h3>
          <p>
            During this time, I had the opportunity to work on deliverables for USAID government projects, as well as conducting research on <a href="https://ibogley.github.io/website/projects/#hide1">barriers to business in the Western Balkans.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Future</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for part time work in the fall, or for stable roles in economic growth/development or data analysis starting in January/February of 2022.
