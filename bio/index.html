          <h2>My Background</h2>
          <h3>High School</h3>
          <p>
            I went to Crescent Valley High school in Corvallis, OR. While there, I enjoyed playing ultimate frisbee competitively.
          </p>
          <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
          <p>
            I began my career at my hometown university of Oregon State, before transferring to the University of Oregon during my freshman year. Soon after, I switched my major from math to economics, while taking two minors in business administration and mathematics. I graduated with a GPA of 3.62, 3.69 major GPA.
          </p>
          <h3>Volunteer Work: ShelterCare</h3>
          <p>
            Over the course of a month, I wrote a <a href="https://ibogley.github.io/website/projects/#show_emp">report</a> summarising the effective usage of employee satisfaction survey data. This document is used to design future surveys, interpret statistics, and use them to improve workplace metrics.
          </p>
          <h3>Graduate</h3>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to take the one year accelerated Applied Master's program here at the University of Oregon. My studies focused on Data Science, Empirical Research, Public Policy, and International Trade. I graduated in December of 2021.
          </p>
          <h3>Volunteer Work: A Family for Every Child</h3>
          <p>
            From July of 2020 to January of 2021, I volunteered with AFFEC to encourage the success of biweekly seminars aimed at connecting foster children and potential adopting families. My role included writing surveys for attendees, collecting data on attendance, updating email marketing materials, and maintaining a database of foster children and adopting families.
          </p>
          <h3>Summer 2021: Intern at International Development Group LLC</h3>
          <p>
            I worked on USAID and MCC Economic Development contracts. A notable example was an MCC Road Improvement project in Niger, where I used Excel to create visuals for road usage patterns and assisted in writing various sections of a baseline data report. Other tasks I was assigned included scoping potential competitors for future RFP's and creating a spreadsheet of subcontractors with their relevant sectoral expertise. I also conducted research on the <a href="https://ibogley.github.io/website/projects/#show_wb">barriers to business in the Western Balkans</a>, which I presented to the company at large.
          </p>
          <h3>Winter 2021-Spring 2022: Local Government Fiscal Note Analyst</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I am creating fiscal notes for local governments associated with bills for the Washington State 2022 Legislative Session. Working in the Washington State Department of Commerce in the Local Government Division, I write budget impact summaries for potential legislation regarding energy policy, infrastructure, economic development, telecommunications, and financial institutions.
          </p>
          <h3>My Hobbies/Passions</h3>
          <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li><strong>The 2008 Financial Crisis</strong>: I enjoyed watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)">The Big Short</a>, and have experience studying the advantages and risks of credit. I have a basic understanding of how a speculative market for mortgages, mixed with the invention of credit default swaps and risk trading assets helped fuel the crisis. This is in addition to my studies of international finance and monetary policy.</li>
            <li><strong>History/Political Economy Analysis</strong>: I enjoy incrementally learning the history and current state of our world. Playing total war games (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War:_Shogun_2">Shogun 2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War:_Three_Kingdoms">Three Kingdoms</a>) especially helped encourage basic personal research into how and why nations are the way they are. This compliments other forrays into American, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and European history.</li>
            <li><strong>Housing</strong>: I personally have felt the effects of the affordable housing crisis. I have interest in helping others avoid this issue, assisting in incrementally improving economic mobility and preventing further income inequality.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit</strong>: I have learned about how credit can help assist anti-poverty initiatives, especially micro-finance programs. I also have respect for the role that responsible debt can have in helping others achieve entrepreneurial and personal goals.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Future</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for roles in economic growth/development or data analysis starting in January/February of 2022.
