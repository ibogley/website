            <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
            <p>
                My passion for data stems from the ways we can use it to communicate. An effective visual can intuitively pass along insights that would otherwise require a wall of text which would loose the interest of some. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my work with Energy Trust of Oregon, I was tasked with creating Power BI Dashboards to clearly visualize the state of data quality issues in the data warehouse. I also presented visual breakdowns of available metrics related to undeliverable checks.
            </p>
            <p>
                For an MCC Road development project during my Internship with IDG, I visualized data in a baseline data report for consumption by USAID. This involved touching base with team members about iterations that worked well in previous reports, gathering data, and using excel to create charts that clearly communicate statistical trends in the data.
            </p>           
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Databases</h1>
            <p>
                With Energy Trust of Oregon, I was responsible for creating SQL queries in Power BI capable of indicating data quality issues. This data came from the organization's data warehouse, which I became familar with. I also spent time in college studying databases, going over topics like relational databases and cloud computing (Google BigQuery).
            </p>
            <h1>Data Analysis/Research</h1>
            <p>
                My previous experiences have often hinged on using data to effectively tackle real-world problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As an intern with the <strong>International Development Group</strong>, I fulfilled a variety of roles involving data analysis. As a project for the summer, I researched the Barriers to Business in the Western Balkans, communicating my findings to the rest of the company both through a written report and a virtual presentation. This undertaking focused on using data from the World Bank to accurately describe issues with private sector activities on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a fiscal note analyst with the <strong>Washington State Department of Commerce</strong>, I was introduced to different tax models. I routinely interpreted fiscal notes from the Department of Revenue describing the assumptions and estimations of potential tax revenue impacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even in the classroom, I found opportunities to put theory to good use. For my Master's degree, I wrote an econometric report deconstructing the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on international trade intensity. I used a fixed effect gravity model to identify a 25% drop in export integration and 8% drop in import integration under quarantine. I also wrote a blog post testing whether the polling errors of the US general election were significantly different between 2016 and 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic curriculum also included exposure to advanced econometrics and machine learning. Specifically, I had the opportunity to work with the TidyModels R package, where I became familiar with the implementation and theory behind models. I coordinated with my classmate Jonas Bowman to complete a project using different models to predict the selection of yearly NBA AllStars with seasonal statistics. I have also completed several projects on my kaggle profile, using machine learning to predict housing prices and titanic survivorship.
            </p>
            <p>
                When given a chance to assist <strong>ShelterCare</strong> with baseline data from employee satisfaction surveys, I visualized and wrote a guide for using it to improve a professional environment. 
            </p>

                Another relevant adventure was my time with <strong>A Family for Every Child</strong>. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are around 400,000 children in foster care in the United States. (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/afcarsreport28.pdf) Under the supervision of the volunteer coordinator, I led a project to improve Child and Family Matching Events. These seminars, which became virtual due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, were aimed at connecting foster children and potential adopting families. To help make these virtual events a success, I:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated the email templates used to market the events.</li>
                <li>Monitored data on the open and click rates of our email-marketing templates.</li>
                <li>Wrote survey questions to monitor attendee experiences through ConstantContact.</li>
                <li>Collected data on the attendance and outcomes of matching events in SalesForce.</li>
            </ul>
