                <h1>Renewable Energy/Utilities</h1>
                <p>
                    While working as a Fiscal Note Analyst with the Washington State Department of Commerce, I gained intimate exposure with a variety of legislation relating to energy and utilities. My job was to rigorously read the content of potential legislation, then reach out to relevant experts in local government to estimate the fiscal impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This role provided exposure to new developments in various renewable technologies around Washington State. I read through bills relating to solar power, green roofs, electrolytic and renewable hydrogen, and electric vehicles. I also established contacts throughout local government agencies and institutions to better understand the rammifications of legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my master's degree, I also took a class on natural resources. This curriculum studied issues in energy production, including the long-run variable cost advantages of renewable technologies, modeling of resource extraction paths, and the importance of local ecosystems in regional economies.

                    I originally studied Economics as a way of using my schooling and expertise in data to assist communities thrives. I enjoy the process of conducting research on regional economic health and development, revealed in my work with the <strong>International Development Group</strong>, where I had the privilege of assisting with USAID and MCC development projects. One notable example was my work in southern Niger, where my work contributed to the improvement of a family of highways which would provide opportunities for travel and trade throughout the region. For this project, I conducted background research, visualized data, and wrote report sections. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My internship also involved conducting research on the barriers to business in the Western Balkans, which involved describing the state of domestic labor markets, SME populations, foreign direct investment, international trade, the energy sector fuel mix, quality of governance, and other relevant metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My graduate academic studies focused on regional economic growth and development. I intentionally chose classes which gave me additional skills to encourage private sector development through public policy. Graduate-level courses included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two quarters of Economic Development</li>
                    <li>One class in urban and regional economies</li>
                    <li>Two courses in macroeconomics and policy analysis</li>
                    <li>Classes in natural resource economics and political economy analysis</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Infrastructure/Public Transportation</h1>
                <p>
                    My work as a fiscal note analyst involved looking over bills to estimate the impact of legislation on local government budgets. For this role, I reviewed bills relating to infrastructure and utilities. This experience provided exposure to local building and zoning codes, as well as legislation relating to roads and bridges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work with the International Development Group also represents relevant experience, as it provided an opportunity to get involved with various infrastructure projects. For an MCC contract in southern Niger, I assisted with a project which would construct road improvements for a family of highways. I am especially proud of this effort, as the rennovation of these highways would directly lead to safer and more accessible travel and trade routes for local populations. My role included visualizing baseline data, conducting background research, and writing report sections for comparison with future information as construction progressed.

                    A variety of experiences both inside and out of the classroom have prepared me to conduct analysis on international economic issues. My work with the International Development Group involved a research project, in which I grew intimately familiar with the role of Foreign Direct Investment in the process of regional growth and development. My studies into the barriers to business in the Western Balkans highlighted the need for small developing nations to integrate with the Western markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my master's degree, I wrote a report deconstructing the impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on International Trade Intensity, finding that export intensity dropped by 25% in comparison to an 8% drop in import intensity. This highlighted that export-driven industries were much more affected than import-driven ones.

                <h1>Governance/Political Economy Analysis</h1>
                <p>
                    I have routinely focused my efforts on studying the state of political institutions and governance. For example, I wrote a report for my Master's degree outlining the magnitude and scope of corruption in modern-day Russia. I also wrote a paper following the economic history of Russia since the breakup of the USSR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also given intimate knowledge of Political Economy Analysis during my internship with the International Development Group. One of my responsibilities was to summarise previous projects in documentation for use in the future. Several of the previous projects were PEA's, detailing the state of countries around the globe.
